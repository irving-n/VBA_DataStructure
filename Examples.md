> Syntax:
  >> For the sake of shorthand & readability, I'll be using the syntax for Python's data structures, lists, tuples, and dictionaries, to represent the class methods' returns that take the form of the VBA data structures, arrays, collections, and dictionaries respectively.

i.e.,
```Python 
# The elements stored by a VBA array will be of the form:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# The elements stored by a VBA collection will be of the form:
('Apple', 'Orange', 'Banana', 'Kiwi', 'Mango')

# The {key: item} pairs stored by a VBA Scripting.Dictionary will be of the form:
{'Apple': 20, 'Orange': 3, 'Banana': 5, 'Kiwi': 14, 'Mango': 11}
```
More detail on the analogue in both **Python** & **VBA** for the above can be found in the appendix.

## **Methods**
## Append

> Adds an element to the end of any of the supported data structures

### Syntax
> *DS*.Append(*body*, *appendix*)

### Example

<details>

## Apply


#### Parameters:

| Variable | Data Type(s) | Description |
| :---: |:--- |:--- |
| DataStructure_Arr | Variant() | The data structure containing elements to be modified |
| func_name | String | The name of the function being applied |
| arg_pos | Integer | The index position of the argument being supplied on each loop through the data structure |
| other_args | (ParamArray) Variant() | Any of the other arguments required by the function in order |

#### Returns:
##### Example 1: [Vowel Shifting]
> Return

>> Given the following user defined function:
```VB
' This function shifts vowels by 1, relative to their ASC representation
Function shift_vowels(ByVal char As String) As String
    shift_vowels = IIf(InStr("aeiou", LCase(char)) > 0, _
                            Chr(Asc(char) + 1), _
                            char)
End Function
```

```VB
Dim arr As Variant
Dim obfuscated_text As Variant
Dim quote As String
quote = "All that is gold does not glitter, " & _
        "Not all those who wander are lost"
arr = DS.CharacterArray(quote)       '['A', 'l', 'l', ' ', 't', 'h', 'a', 't', ... , 'l', 'o', 's', 't']
obfuscated_text = Join(DS.Apply(arr, "letter_shift", 0), "")
```
> All vowels shifted:
>> Bll thbt js gpld dpfs npt gljttfr, Npt bll thpsf whp wbndfr brf lpst

<br/>

 ##### Example 2: [Simple Math]

```VB
Dim numbers As Variant
Dim output As Variant
arr = Array(2, 4, 6, 8)
output = DS.Apply(arr, "2*", 0)
```

> All elements doubled:
```Python
[4, 8, 12, 16]
```

#### Please note that the feature is fairly limited at the moment since it makes use of the restrictive Eval (Access) / Application.Evaluate (Excel) function
- The mathematical operator and any numbers must come before the element in the array
- The example above creates an expression of the form:
```VB
Application.Evaluate("2*" & "(" & element & ")") 'Where [element] is the control in the for-each-loop governing the output array sourced from the input data structure
```

<br/>

| --- | --- | --- |

#### Returns:
> An array with UBound = len(text) - 1, having each character of the provide String as a separate element
```VB
' Comment
Dim book_title as String
Dim all_characters as Variant
book_title = "La Belle Sauvage"
all_characters = DS.CharacterArray(book_title)
```
```Python

Dim dict As Scripting.Dictionary
Dim ingredients() As String
Dim keys As Variant
Dim in_stock() As Boolean

Set dict = New Scripting.Dictionary


```



#### Example 2: Array(s) to dictionary of collections

## Copy
#### Parameters:

#### N.b.:
* The keys of a collection must be supplied as an optional argument *(implementation in progress)*; on their own, the keys of a collection object are irretrievable.
* Nested objects will only be copied by reference.

| Variable | Data Type(s) | Description |
| :---: |:--- |:--- |
| DataStructure | Variant(), Collection, Dictionary | The data structure to copy |
| failOnNestedObjects | Boolean | Pass parameter as True in order to cause the method to return an empty Variant/Collection/Dictionary instead of returning nested references; this will prevent the nested objects from being mutated |
| args | (optional) Variant | *Implementation in progress* - keys if attempting to copy a collection |
| --- | --- | --- |

#### Returns:
> A newly created array/collection/dictionary containing the same data from the supplied data structure. Collection keys will not be preserved.

## Exists
#### Parameters:

| Variable | Data Type(s) | Description |
| :---: |:--- |:--- |
| needle | Variant | The thing to find |
| haystack | Variant(), Collection, Dictionary | Where to look |
| wildcard_needle | Boolean | Toggle whether to use the 'like' operator on the [needle] argument |
| wildcard_haystack | Boolean | Toggle whether to use the 'like' operator on the haystack |

#### Returns:
> Boolean: True if the needle is in the haystack, False otherwise

### Example: *Given a set of painting colors (requested supplies) and a list of what's in stock... Check whether any of the the following are true:*
* An exact color-match exists (by comparing color names)
* A potential close-color-match exists (by comparing color name)

```VB
    Dim supplies As Variant
    Dim needles As Variant, needle As Variant
    Dim results As Collection, results_wc_needle As Collection, results_wc_supplies As Collection, results_wc_all As Collection 'wc:  wildcard
    Dim zipped_results As Variant
    
    Set results = New Collection
    Set results_wc_needle = New Collection
    Set results_wc_supplies = New Collection
    Set results_wc_all = New Collection
    
    needles = Array("red", "green", "blue", "off-white", "magenta")
    supplies = Array("red", "mint green", "black", "yellow", "sunset orange", "crimson", "light blue", "white")
    
    For Each needle In needles ' "red", "green", "blue", "off-white", "magenta"
        results.Add Array(needle, DS.Exists(needle, supplies))
        results_wc_needle.Add Array(needle, DS.Exists(needle, supplies, wildcard_needle:=True, wildcard_supplies:=False))
        results_wc_supplies.Add Array(needle, DS.Exists(needle, supplies, wildcard_needle:=False, wildcard_supplies:=True))
        results_wc_all.Add Array(needle, DS.Exists(needle, supplies, wildcard_needle:=True, wildcard_supplies:=True))
    Next needle

    zipped_results = DS.Zip(results, results_wc_needle, results_wc_supplies, results_wc_all)

```
> Result:

| Color | Exists w/o modifier | Exists w/ wildcard "needle" | Exists w/ wildcard "haystack" | Exists w/ both wildcards applied |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **red** | True | True | True | True |
| **green** | False | True | False | True |
| **blue** | False | True | False | True |
| **off-white** | False | False | True | True |
| **magenta** | False | False | False | False |

> Explanation: 
>> * **Red** matches because there is an exact match of color in existing supplies
>> * **Green** doesn't have an exact match but matches in the statement mint_green (wc applied to supplies) like "\*green\*" (wc applied to requested)
>> * The same applies to "\***blue**\*", with "light blue"
>> * **off-white** doesn't have an exact match but "\*white\*" is like "\*off-white\*"
>> * **Magenta** has no match, nor does it have a wildcard match
